This approach endeavors to uncover concealed details within optical satellite images that challenge human perception due to limitations in human visual ability and image resolution constraints. Central to this methodology is the conversion matrix, which plays a pivotal role in modifying colors across a spectrum of images, thereby enhancing the human eye's capacity to distinguish intricate color gradients. This capability proves indispensable, particularly in enhancing visibility within low-density images where subtle color disparities may escape notice. Utilizing a cutting-edge approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this capability's importance is heightened, effectively amplifying the discernibility of nuanced color variations within the images.
